This is my MOD 2 project which i have completed learning at Per Scholas

I have used 2 class compenents and 5 functional components/stateless components.

I Have used React routers, React DOM, class components, classless components, two API's to get information. One Api in class component the other in classless component.I have used AJAX (fetch) requests for the APIS.

Purpose of this project was to create a User Interface library which a clint can use to search for books based off on user input. Also to be able to search random books to read. I have used CSS for styling.
